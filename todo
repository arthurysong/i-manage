- Refactor Components connect some containers to redux so we don't have to pass in props

- Reformat UserShow because we're using AuthUser show for when user is logged in;

- FormErrors when unmounted I need to clear errors.
   X Create clearErrors method dispatch action!.
    Need to do this for all components that use FormErrors..

X Style FormErrors component li elements. => FormErrors styled.

? Change so Jumbotron is in app component so all routes will have Jumbotron => For now I will put Bootstrap components into each component
 because I'm not sure how to combine Routes and Bootstrap components...

X Change home Component to use css instead of cols => Home jumbo uses css!

X when you login you're directed authuserbalance => Login redirects to proper page.

- style app with bootstrap!
    - jumbotron to contain
    - list group?
    - button
    - navbar
    - spinner for loading?
    - table for payments

X Payments should be a float with 2 decimal => payments are now to 2 decimal points as well as balances
    Validation... 
    for trying to submit payment
    - payments are floats and there are validations now!!!!!!!!

X manager can see her own page => There is link to see manager's own profile now
    Link to her page

X refactor unit and user show => refactored out payments section!
    there is a lot of repeated code
    I think I can abstract out a component..

X user can make payments => User can now make payments.
    => I need to add validations for payments X
    => Display errors X

? Can I make user authentication work with fetch???
    I don't think this is possible
    Because Rails needs access to browser to make sessions work..

? find out how to push without typing in password everytime

? catch errors

X new residentform => new residency form

X authenticating users
